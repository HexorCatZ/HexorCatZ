- 👋 Hi, I’m @HexorCatZ
- 👀 I’m interested in helping others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about github itself 😂. (after loosing all my code when i forget to backup before formatting 😂. PS: im sure i had a copy somewhere. 😰)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on others code that can be improvise or advanced.
- 📫 How to reach me? ummm~~~ hexorcatz@protonmail.com i guess. 🤔

Memorial of the code that was gone :
- nh-dnsmasq : automate the process of dnsmasq and iptables for hotspot
- nh-security : constantly check for ssh and wifi deauth attack.
   - popped up a terminal window with up to date info if does on ssh and automatically block the ip address
   - popped up a terminal window with up to date info and reconnect to wifi with a fake password for a few times before connecting it with a real password later on.
      - fake password is mostly just a random password in a rockyou.txt
      - wonder what happen if a guy thought he found a password but failed when he try to connect to it. 😅
- ifmode : change the interface to/from monitor, managed, and ad-hoc
   - ( because kali 2.0 had a bug on aircrack-ng when it was first release )
- nh-msfconsole [alias to msfconsole] : just to start postgresql on startup and close it when its over (when postgress 0-days exploit was discoverred)
- lot more of my code that i didnt use after a while (i didnt forget all of you code-chan. 😿) [actually i forget. 🤣🤫]
